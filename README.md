# Classification-of-human-brain-MR-imaging-with-MLP

This is the CLANU project brief. The aim of this project is to put into practice a method presented in numerical analysis in a context of real data and to get you to design software in Matlab. 
More specifically, this year we will be looking at the use of a neural network learning method generalised to the multi-class framework, with the aim of identifying types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. 
The goal is to automatically recognise the orientation (axial, coronal, sagittal) and the type of MRI acquisition (T1, T2, PD), i.e. to recognise 1 class out of 9.
