# Classification-of-human-brain-MRI-images-with-MLP

This is the CLANU project brief. The aim of this project is to put into practice a method presented in numerical analysis in a context of real data and to get you to design software in Matlab. More specifically, a neural network learning method (MLP) generalised to the multi-class framework is used, with the aim of identifying types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The goal is to automatically recognise the orientation (axial, coronal, sagittal) and the type of MRI acquisition (T1, T2, PD), and to classify the MR images according to these characteristics.

In this repository:
1. nn_classification is the main script: enjoy this simple MLP model by tuning its parameters and hyperparameters!
2. note_finale is my notes. Read it to get a rough idea of the whole model and its results.
3. The MLP model is in the +L_layers_nn folder, also the script for prediction.
4. +visu for visualization functions
5. +database for splitting the whole dataset in 3: train, validation and test.
6. data contains the original dataset for this project.
